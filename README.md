### What I learned

How to use variables in CSS

Use more than one picture html
The picture tag contains source tags in it. Within the source tag,it must have a media property in it. This property is used to define when that picture 
is shown. It also doesnt have a src attribute but rather it has an srcset attribute.

section tag is for one off standalone content.

To make images responsive set the ff values on the image itself not on the div containing the image.
